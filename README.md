# pcc-java

This is where I'm storing my notes for my community college Java class. The class teaches the first four chapters of **Objects First with BlueJ**.

### Book Notes
I have book notes collected as markdown files. I also left a template for moving the markdown into **Strapdown.js** for viewing as a web page.

### Code
No code in here thus far. I'll upload my projects once I can convert them from "BlueJ" code to, well, actual code. Like, with a *main* and everything.
